Tokyo ("Eastern Capital") officially Tokyo Metropolis, is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan, and is both
the capital and largest city of Japan. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world.
</p>
<p>
It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kanto region on the southeastern
 side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been
 the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters.
