				<p>Welcome to Bronxville Programming.<p>
				<p>We aim to bring advanced programmers and new coders together to build club project, develop our skills, have fun coding as a group.</p>
				<p>This year we have several cool projects lined up, including a club website, BXV App, Varsity Sports Fantasy Game, Investment-Club-collaboration Stock Algorithm, and an assignment posting tool. We also plan to run learning segments on Computer Security, Digital Networks, and other topics.</p>
