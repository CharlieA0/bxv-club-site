				<p>Welcome to Bronxville Programming.<p>
				
				<p>We aim to bring advanced programmers and new coders together to build club projects, develop our skills, have fun coding as a group.</p>
				
				<p>This year we have several cool projects lined up, including a club website, a BXV App, a Varsity Sports Fantasy Game, an Investment-Club-collaboration Stock Algorithm, and an 	
				assignment posting tool. We also plan to run learning segments on Computer Security, Digital Networks, and other topics.</p>
				
				<p>Anyway, come down the <b>C-Wing Computer Lab during Lunch, Wednesday</b> and join us for Coding, Computing, and more fun. Absolutely no experience required.</p>
